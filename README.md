# Sudoku-Solver-and-Animation
This project builds and solves Sudoku boards using 2 methods.
    
    Method 1: Brute force backtracking algorithm
    Method 2: Backtracking, but uses a hurestic to determine the best box to fill next.  This greatly reduces the number of backtracks that happen which impoves               speed dramatically

This project can also animate the sudoku board as it is solved, and saves the animation to a .mp4 file.
